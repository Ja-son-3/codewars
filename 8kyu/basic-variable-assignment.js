// This code should store "codewa.rs" as a variable called name but it's not working. Can you figure out why?

//Given
    // var a == "code";
    // var b == "wa.rs";
    // var name == a + b;

//Parameters: Given two string parameters.
//Results: Make name return a value of "codewa.rs"
//Examples:
    // assert.strictEqual(name, "codewa.rs");
//Pseudocode: 
    //1. Change the equal to operators to a declaration operator.
//Time Complexity: Constant or 0(1)

var a = "code";
var b = "wa.rs";
var name = a + b;
