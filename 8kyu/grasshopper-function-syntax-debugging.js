// A student was working on a function and made some syntax mistakes while coding. Help them find their mistakes and fix them. 

//Parameters: Given two string parameters, representing a verb and noun.
//Results: Return a string of the verb plus the noun.
//Examples:
    // Test.assertEquals(main('take ', 'item'), 'take item')

//Pseudocode: 
    //1. Convert the square brackets containing the functions parameters into parenthesis.
    //2. Encase the function in curly brackets.
//Time Complexity: O(1) or Constant
