// Messi's Goal Total
    // Use variables to find the sum of the goals Messi scored in 3 competitions

// Information
    // Messi goal scoring statistics:

// Competition	Goals
    // La Liga	43
    // Champions League	10
    // Copa del Rey	5

// Task
    // Create these three variables and store the appropriate values using the table above:
    // laLigaGoals
    // championsLeagueGoals
    // copaDelReyGoals

// Create a fourth variable named totalGoals that stores the sum of all of Messi's goals for this year.

//Parameters: Given variables representing the goals of messi in their respective leagues.
//Results: Set the totalGoals variable to the sum of laLigaGoals, championsLeagueGoals and copaDelReyGoals.
//Examples:
    // Test.assertEquals(totalGoals, 58)
//Pseudocode: 
    //1. Set LaligaGoals to 43, set championsLeagueGoals to 10, and set copaDelReyGoals to 5
    //2. Set totalGoals to the sum of laLigaGoals, championsLeagueGoals and copaDelReyGoals.
//Time Complexity: Constant or O(1)

var laLigaGoals = 43
var championsLeagueGoals = 10
var copaDelReyGoals = 5

var totalGoals = laLigaGoals + championsLeagueGoals + copaDelReyGoals
